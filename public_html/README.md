# CS3500 - Midterm Project
This is Team 7's Project for CS3500 - Intro To Web Technologies at WMU.

## Goals
1. To apply all the fundamental and basic knowledge gathered during the first half of the semester about HTML and CSS.
2. To understand design and functionality concepts.
3. To build a proper website.

## Instructions

* Your midterm project should be an informational website or web pages on a topic of your choosing. There are a few recommended project types listed below. Each group will read the requirements for their specific project type.
* You will code your website and place all the necessary files and folders under a single folder named /Midterm_teamX (replace X with your team number). After completing the project, please compress the file folder containing all the necessary files into a single zipped file named Midterm_teamX.zip and upload it to the dropbox in Elearning under Midterm Project Code Submission on or before the due date. Failure to adhere to these instructions will result in a 10% penalty to your teams grade.
* You are recommended to use the Bootstrap framework to give a general style to your site. For a list of different Bootstrap themes go to bootswatch.com (v3). Once your team has decided on a theme, you will provide custom CSS code which further modifies your website. In doing so you will demonstrate your mastery of CSS concepts and techniques. I.E. You will not receive credit for CSS mastery if you only use Bootstrap.
* Make sure to perform extensive testing of your website, so you can find and fix as many bugs as possible before the evaluation.
* Your project should implement a responsive design in which your website adapts to the different output media (smartphone, tablets, laptops, desktops, and so on). I.E. Your website is reflected appropriately on any device with minimal to no errors. Watch out for overflow!
* Your site should make appropriate use of white space. This allows for the information and intention to be convey appropriately. This is a balancing act as you want your content to be the primary focus but also have ease of navigation. You should not have to much white space nor should the content be organized to tightly.
* Keep it simple and do not overwhelm yourselves, make sure the basics are covered before starting miscellaneous features.

## Technologies and Concepts

Each team will make use of the technologies explained in class so far, as well as internet resources to complete the midterm project. All sources used in the development of your website should be referenced appropriately in a dedicated text file. Organize your reference file so each member has a section. Furthermore, include the webpages the references are applied to. Some technologies you may use are:

* HTML5.
* CSS 3 and Bootstrap Framework (version 3.xx and above).

## Basic Requirements

Each member of your team will have at least four (4) HTML pages. Additionally, your team has four (4) pages in which you will work together on [These pages are a team effort and do not count toward your individual requirement]:

* A page named index.html which will represent the home page or landing page of your project. This page must contain:
    * a navigation menu which will help users to navigate through your website.
    * General content which summarizes the point of your website.
* A page named about.html with information about the web developers (you and your teammate). This page must contain your names, project team number, and a description of what your project is about (This page will function as the midterm project report).
* A page named catalog.html which will list items (such as products, events, courses, books, games and songs) with their details. A catalog is a complete enumeration of items arranged systematically with descriptive details.
* A page named references.html which lists each team member, the references they used, and the locations on website they applied information from the references. References should adhere to the IEEE citation guidelines.
* You should also include features like forms, images, and videos.
* Create other pages that are appropriate to the themes of your website.
